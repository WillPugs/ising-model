# stat-mech-monte-carlo
 Computer simulation using Monte Carlo Methods to estimate the long-term thermodynamic behavior of various models in statistical mechanics and estimate critical exponents near phase transitions.
 
 Models simulated: Ising model (1D, 2D, 3D, arbitrary higher dimensions), XY model (1D, 2D).
 
 Models planned: Heisenberg model, n-vector model in arbitrary dimensions.
 
 The my_math.py module is a custom math module that I made to help with the implementation of this and other projects. See https://github.com/WillPugs/custom-math-module for more details.
